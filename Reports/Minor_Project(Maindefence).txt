\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\setcounter{page}{1}
\section{INTRODUCTION}
In the ever-evolving landscape of talent acquisition and recruitment, the ability to swiftly and accurately evaluate a multitude of resumes is paramount. The Resume Parser project emerges as a technological milestone, introducing a groundbreaking solution to streamline the traditionally intricate process of resume screening.\\

\noindent Harnessing the power of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, with a specific emphasis on the formidable Spacy library for Named Entity Recognition (NER), this project seeks to redefine the efficiency and precision of extracting essential information from resumes. The essence of our endeavor lies in providing a comprehensive, yet concise, summary of resumes, covering critical facets such as names, skills, educational qualifications, and professional experiences.\\

\noindent This project's significance is underscored by its potential to revolutionize the hiring process, offering recruiters and human resources professionals a tool that not only expedites resume evaluation but also enhances decision-making through intelligent entity extraction. As we delve into the intricacies of the Resume Parser, we embark on a journey to reshape the landscape of resume analysis, setting new standards for efficiency and effectiveness in the realm of talent acquisition.

\newpage

\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}
The manual parsing of resumes is time-consuming and prone to errors. HR professionals often spend significant hours extracting relevant details from resumes, leading to delays in the hiring process. Our project seeks to eliminate this bottleneck by automating the extraction process.

\section{OBJECTIVES}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a resume parser using ML NER to automate the extraction of key information from resumes.
    \item Enhance recruitment efficiency by accurately identifying and categorizing entities, streamlining the candidate screening process
\end{enumerate}

\section{PROJECT SCOPE}
\textbf{Resume Ranking System:} \\
Utilize the extracted summary data to develop a dynamic resume ranking system for HR recruiters. By incorporating relevant factors such as skills, education, and experiences, the system can intelligently prioritize and present resumes, aiding recruiters in identifying top candidates efficiently\\

\noindent \textbf{Job Recommendation System::} \\
Leverage the skillsets extracted from resumes to create a job recommendation system. This system can match candidate profiles with open positions, providing recruiters with tailored suggestions based on the candidate's expertise, thereby streamlining the job matching process.\\

\noindent \textbf{Customized Interview Questions:}\\
Utilize the extracted information to generate customized interview questions tailored to the specific skills and experiences of each candidate. This ensures that the interview process is focused and relevant, providing a deeper understanding of the candidate's suitability for the role.\\

\newpage
\noindent \textbf{Career Pathway Recommendations:}\\
Develop a feature that suggests potential career pathways for candidates based on their skills and experiences. This could include recommending additional certifications, training programs, or lateral moves within the organization, promoting career development and growth.



\chapter{LITERATURE REVIEW}
\section{RELATED THEORIES}
\noindent \textbf{Natural Language Processing:}\\
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.\\

\noindent \textbf{Named Entity Recognition}\\
Named-entity recognition (NER) also known as named entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction is a sub-task of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.\\

\noindent \textbf{Spacy}\\
Spacy is an open-source natural language processing (NLP) library designed for efficient and practical implementation of various NLP tasks. It is written in Python and provides pre-trained models and tools for processing and analyzing human language.\\

\chapter{REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS}

\section{FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS}

Functional requirements describe what a system is supposed to accomplish. They define the specific features, capabilities, and functionalities that the system must have to meet the needs of its users. Functional requirements focus on "what" the system should do.These are our functional requirements of our projects. \\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{File Upload:}\\
    The system allows users to upload resumes in popular formats such as PDF and DOCX so that the user could get the summary of the resume.\\
    
    \item \textbf{Resume Parsing}\\
    The system categorizes entities such as names, skills, educational qualifications, and experiences from the resume using the trained model that is trained from different datasets collected from various sources.\\

    \item \textbf{Resume Summary Generation:}\\
    The system generates a structured summary for each uploaded resume, presenting extracted information in a clear and organized manner.
    
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\section{NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS}
Non-functional requirements define the qualities or attributes that describe how the system should behave. They focus on characteristics such as performance, usability, security, and reliability. Non-functional requirements provide constraints and criteria for the system's overall behavior. Some of the non-functional requirements of our pojects are as follows:\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Availability}\\
    The system is available for use 24 hours without planned downtime.\\

    \item \textbf{User Friendly}\\
    The system has easy to use user interface, requires minimal training for users.\\

    \item\textbf{Compatibility:}\\
    The system is compatible with common browsers, operating systems, and devices.\\
    
    
    
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{METHODOLOGY}
The proposed system with Named Entity Recognition for Resume Parsing includes 
following blocks:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Dataset:} \\
 This refers to the original dataset that contains the resume of people .The datasets were secondary datasets which were available on different sites on internet such as Kaggle, Github and some datasets were manually created by us.\\

  \item \textbf{Data Preprocesssing:} \\
This step involves preparing the dataset for training and testing.In our case, we annoted the resumes ."Annotation" refers to the process of adding metadata or additional information to a resume document.This metadata typically includes details about the various sections and elements within the resume. Data preprocessing ensures that the data is in a suitable format for the machine learning model.

\item \textbf{Preprocessed Data:} \\
This is the dataset after applying the data preprocessing techniques. It contains the transformed dataset which is in JSON format ready for further analysis and model training.

 
\item \textbf{Train-Test Split:} \\
The preprocessed data is split into two sets: the training set and the testing set. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. The split is typically done randomly, allocating a certain percentage of the data to each set (e.g., 80\% for training, 20\% for testing).\\

\newpage
\item \textbf{Training Set:} \\
This subset of the preprocessed data is used to train the NER model. It includes the annotated data set  used to teach the model the underlying patterns and relationships.\\

\item \textbf{Loading into Spacy:} \\
The training datasets are loaded into spacy to obtain the docbin file so that these docbin file are used to train the NER model\\

\item \textbf{Training NER model:} \\
This step involves training the model to apply Named Entity Recognition such that it identifies the metadata or the entities from the text\\

\item \textbf{Trained NER model:} \\
After the NER model is trained, it becomes a trained model that can be used for entity recognition. It encapsulates the learned probabilities and distributions, enabling it to make predictions on unseen data with the accuracy score of 86 \% .\\



 \end{enumerate}
